<p>Our trip to the Douro valley</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Last Friday we decided to take Marselha and Bruni, and drive up the Douro River with the full family, including the grandparents.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Early Autumn is one of the most, if not THE most, best times to have a motorhome trip! Most of days are still sunny, the temperatures are very nice (we got up to 28¬∫ at night!) and there aren‚Äôt that many tourists.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We left Friday evening. Just before starting, we put the kids washing their teeth and wear their pajamas. The youngest went sleeping to the lower bunk bed, the oldest went to our bed to watch a movie, while we started our short journey from Porto to Peso da R√©gua (or simply R√©gua).</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Part of the trip was on highway, so I was glad to be doing it by night, since we had a more peaceful voyage with the kids sleeping and no traffic at all. We arrived in R√©gua just before midnight. After a couple of minutes after parking we‚Äôre all sleeping with the sound of Douro River flowing outside.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>R√©gua, apart from being a very know tourist destination, specially because all it‚Äôs tradicion about the Port Wine, has one of the best and free motorhome parking places.Very close to the river, near the old bridge, there are space for more than 30 motorhome, with all the comforts, from free clean water and chemical WC waste facilities.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>After waking up and taking our complete breakfast &#8211; which must always include scramble eggs, toast, tea and hot chocolate; with a stunning view of the Douro River and listening to some music, we dressed up and went for a short bicycle ride.</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>If I haven‚Äôt yet mentioned, bicycles are a most have for any motorhome trip, specially if they are electric :D. You can park the motorhome anywhere and go visit / travel / shopping by bicycle.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>From the motorhome park till the center, there‚Äôs a bike lane that follows the river, with some children parks in the middle. We went to visit the ‚ÄúMuseu do Douro‚Äù (Douro Museum), which is located on a beautiful building and has some exhibitions related with the Douro Wine and its traditions.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our next stop was Pinh√£o, a very picturesque village, located on the north bank of the river Douro, the center of the wine region and the place where wine estates are located.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The landscape of Pinh√£o is classified by UNESCO as a cultural heritage of humanity, and when you visit it, you‚Äôll understand why! The vineyards, in ladder, facing the douro river provide a visual painting you‚Äôll never forget.</p>
<p></p>

							<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 400; color: #333333; font-style: normal;">The grandparents, that were traveling on Bruni, meet us at Pinh√£o. Together we drove through the fantastic landscapes of Douro, passing on the hold train town of Ferradosa.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 400; color: #333333; font-style: normal;">By the end of the day, we headed to Torre de Moncorvo &#8211; a very small town, with a lovely townsquare and a very good restaurant &#8211; o <a href="https://www.restauranteolagar.com.pt/">Lagar</a>, located on the other side of the church. This restaurant servers tradicional Portuguese dishes, such as Codefish, Octopus and, not so tradicional but incredibly tasty, the boar.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 400; color: #333333; font-style: normal;">To spend the night, we went to Foz do Sabor, a magical place where the Rio Sabor meets with Douro River. It&#8217;s one of the best places to spend the night on the Douro &#8211; you can park with a gorgeous view over the windows, where you can see the tourism boats go up the river. It provides a very green grass place to take out the tables and chairs &#8211; which we provide for free <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> and have a breakfast or lunch.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 400; color: #333333; font-style: normal;">We spend the rest of the day enjoying the fantastic weather, taking some sun, swimming on the river, playing with the dogs&#8230; these are truly the best moments of being in holidays on the wilderness!</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 400; color: #333333; font-style: normal;">Without noticing, the time went by and, by the end of Sunday, it was time to return and plan our next trip to find more hidden gems that Portugal has to offer.</p>						</div>

<p>The trip to Cangas, Pontevedra and Vila Nova de Cerveira</p>



<p>On a sunny early Autumn Friday, we decided to take the kids and go up north. This time of the year, from September till the end of October, we still get very warm days and they are the perfect time for a getaway trip.<br>On that Friday we left work at lunchtime, just in time to pack our things on Marselha and hit the road.<br>Since our youngest still has his afternoon nap, we put him to bed, and we forced Rodri to read a book (instead, as usual, to watch a movie). With everything ready, we set course to the north: Galicia, Spain.<br>After one and a half hour driving, we arrived in Cangas (just a bit north of Vigo): a perfect beach, with clear water and a fantastic view over the Islas Cies. The roads, especially near the beach, are a little bit narrow, but a motorhome can cross them (not recommended for very big motorhomes &#8211; with 6 wheels).<br></p>



<p>When we arrived, a couple of hours before the sunset, we parked with the table window facing the sea, and we just couldn&#8217;t believe: such a view, so good weather and almost no one at the beach!<br>Kika was the first to get out and started immediately her wild running &#8211; what we call the 5 minutes of pure madness <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> We went immediately after her.<br>The most braves went for swimming on the &#8220;not-so-cold-as -expected&#8221; water &#8211; to take advantage of the late summer. Afterward, we simply stayed on the beach playing, resting, making some movies and enjoying the time.<br>For dinner, Andrea took her famous &#8220;Bacalhau √† br√°s&#8221; &#8211; one of the multiple codfish dishes typical in Portugal, which we followed with a good &#8220;Pera Doce&#8221; bottle of red wine. With such warm weather, we went for the small and familiar beach bar to eat an ice-cream. The rest of the evening went by watching a movie with Rodri.<br>On the next day, as usual, Johnny was the first to wake up, and I went for a small running &#8211; along with Kika, through the empty beach. When I returned, the breakfast was ready &#8211; toasts with scrambled eggs and some fresh fruit.<br>Before departing, I took a hot water shower &#8211; one of the privileges of having a motorhome with you. We left after lunch &#8211; Pontevedra was our next destination.<br></p>



<p>On Pontevedra, we parked on a very complete and spacious motorhome parking, located in a green area near the river and the &#8220;Est√°dio da Xuventu&#8221;. We took out the bicycles and cycled to the city center to admire the old city, its buildings, the architecture and the &#8220;plazas&#8221;. We stopped on the &#8220;Plaza da Ferraria&#8221; for eating an ice-cream and walk along the &#8220;San Pedro&#8221; garden.<br>At sunset, we decided to leave and head back to Portugal.</p>
