							<p></p>
<p>These are the precautions you need to take on a motorhome trip:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fuel </em>&#8211; Obviously if you want to drive the motorhome you‚Äôll need fuel (diesel). The fuel deposits are around 70-80 liters and the fuel consumption is around 10-12 l/100km, so you can expect and autonomy of around 550 kms till 800 kms, depending on your driving.</li>
<li><em>Battery </em>‚ÄúElectric energy‚Äù &#8211; You need electric energy to power the lights, the water pump, the TV and charge your mobile phone. All our motorhomes have one battery for the car and one or 2, special batteries for the ‚Äúhome‚Äù. These batteries are charged when you drive, by the solar panel or when connected to the electric socket.<br />Since we provide a solar panel on all motorhomes, you‚Äôll never need to worry with the batteries running low. In such extreme cases, if you‚Äôre not on a campsite connected to the 220v electric power, you‚Äôll need to switch on the engine to charge the batteries.</li>
<li><em>Gas </em>&#8211; We supply all our motorhomes with 2 gas bottles: one completely full and another that can be used. A gas bottle will last more than 20 days of consecutive usage for the fridge and water heating, so this isn‚Äôt something you‚Äôll need to worry about.<br />The gas is used to heat up the water, heat the ‚Äúhome‚Äù on cold days and power the fridge when you are parked outside a campsite.</li>
<li><em>Water </em>&#8211; All our motorhomes have a water deposit of 120L or bigger. For a family of 4 people, this will last you around 2-3 days of showers, dish washing and other normal water usage. So, you need to plan to, every couple of days, either spend the night on a campsite, which offer the services to fill up the water tank, or you‚Äôll need to go to a motorhome service area:<br />Whenever you fill up clean water you‚Äôll also need to empty the grey water tank (water used to shower, dishwashing, etc). Typically the grey water tank has the same capacity as the clean water tank;</li>
<li><em>Chemical toilet</em> &#8211; On a motorhome, you‚Äôll also need to plan to empty the chemical toilet. On a regular use, 4 persons will fill up the chemical toilet in 2-3 days so you‚Äôll also need to plan to empty the cassette every couple of days. You can do this on a campsite or on the multiple motorhome service areas available in Portugal.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In resume, <strong>we recommend that once every 2 days, you either plan to sleep on a campsite or you go to a motorhome service are to fill up the clean water, empty the grey water tank and the WC cassette</strong>. The gas and 12v electricity last for a very long time so it‚Äôs not something you‚Äôll need to worry about.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In Portugal and Spain there are a¬†lot of Motorhome service areas. They are marked with a special sign so you can easily find them.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally every campsite also has a special place where you can service the motorhome. To find the nearest service area, campsite or motorhome park, we strongly recommend you to install the App <a href="https://www.caramaps.com/">Caramaps</a> or¬†<a href="https://park4night.com/">Park4Night</a>, available on both Android and Apple IOS.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>If you still have any question or doubt, we are available 24/7 on whatsapp to assist you.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Enjoy your motorhome holidays <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>If you wish to completely explore a country, specially all those hidden places, your best and most affordable bet is to rent a motorhome or a campervan. The question is: what is best for you?</p>



<p>Both options allow you to travel from one beach to another, visit old towns and castles, sleep by a river side‚Ä¶ But what is really different is the space and quality of the interior.</p>



<p>First, lets clarify the differences between a camper van and a motorhome:</p>



<p>A Camper Van is typically a cargo vehicle, with all the exterior in metal exactly has provided by the car manufacturer. There is generally no divide between the cab and the living quarters. It has basic facilities for cooking, washing, and sleeping. The doors are original &#8211; typically there&#8217;s a double door on the back and a sliding door on the side.</p>



<p>A motorhome is a vehicle built on top of a truck or bus chassis and designed to serve as self-contained living quarters for recreational travel. There is normally a divide between the cab and the living quarters behind, which contain sleeping space, WC with shower, and kitchen facilities.</p>



<p>The life inside a campervan is much more restricted &#8211; you typically do not have a toilet (you need to go outside <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> and the beds are much smaller. In opposite, most motorhomes provide a very livable space, where you can actually eat, cook, see a movie, go to the bathroom, take a shower, everything without needing to go outside.<br></p>



<p>To travel, a camper van typically provides a slightly lower fuel consumption &#8211; +/- 8-10 l/100km, comparing with 10-12 l/100km of the motorhomes, and you can drive a little bit faster. The other advantage is the cost &#8211; a campervan is significantly much more cheaper than a motorhome.<br></p>



<p>In resume, for young couples or small group of friends, who don‚Äôt want to spend much money on the rental and only plan to use the CamperVan for traveling &#8211; most of the rest of the activities, like showering eating, etc, will be done outside, then the Camper Van is your best choice.</p>



<p>If you plan to travel with your family or a bigger group of friends and if you want to have a more home-like experience and comfort, then a fully equipped motorhome is your best choice.<br></p>
